# numrec
This is my take in handwritten number recognition. This is an exercise for me, so I did not use any external sources to figure out the logic of the algorithm


## Usage

```bash
python3 translate.py [inputPic]
```

## What does the algorithm do?

<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="two.PNG" width="256" height="256">
    <img src="p0_two.png" width="256" height="256">
    <img src="p1_two.png" width="256" height="256">
    <img src="p2_two.png" width="256" height="256">
</div>

The pics are not to scale.
